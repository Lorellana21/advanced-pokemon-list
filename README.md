# Pokemon evolution

Have you had you a look at [Pokemon List](https://lorellana21.github.io/pokemon-list/)?
Because this is an evolution of such an exercise ðŸš€

âœ” Here it is possible to filter by pokemon name:

ðŸ”¶ When typing in the header input, pokemons whose name does not match what is typed should be hidden.

ðŸ”¶ Of course, it doesnÂ´t matter if you write the text in upper or lower case.

âœ” You also will be able to add more pokemons to the list (your favourite pokemons :)

âœ” As all the data is local, it will be saved in the local storage. So, next time you enter the web you can see your last added pokemons and, you can add even more.
