# Pokemon evolution

Have you had you a look at [Pokemon List](https://lorellana21.github.io/pokemon-list/)?
Because this is an evolution of such an exercise ðŸš€

âœ” The application should allow filtering by pokemon name:

      ðŸ”¶ When typing in the header input, pokemons whose name does not match what is typed should be hidden.
   
      ðŸ”¶ Of course it should not matter if the user writes the text in upper or lower case.
   
âœ” We also want the user to be able to add more pokemons to the list.

âœ” All the data is local, so we can save it in the local storage.
